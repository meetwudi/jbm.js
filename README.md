## Jbm (under planning stage)
JavaScript benchmark tool. Jbm combines the fancy Webworker and DOMHighResTimeStamp to test performance.

## Installation

## Usage
If `window.define` is detected, then you can use AMD style module loader.

```
define('myModule', ['jbm'], function (jbm) {
    return ...;
});
```

If `window.define` is not detected, then you can reference jbm via `window.jbm`

```
var jbm = window.jbm
```

## API
#### noConflict
If you don't want Jbm pollute your `window` object, you can use `noConflict` to restore `window.jbm`. `noConflict` also returns `jbm` object itself.

```
(function(window) {
  var jbm = window.jbm.noConflict();
})(window);
```

#### runTest(name, fn)
Start a test. `name` would be the name of the test, which helps you distinguish test cases.  
You have to put all code to be tested in the `fn` function, the main body of the test case. 

```
jbm.runTest('Test1', function() {
  var i;
  for (i = 0; i < 1000; i ++) {
    doSomeThing();
  }
});
```

When the test case finishes, the reporter will tell you how long does your test case run with a precision of **10 Âµs**.  
`fn` also accepts an optional argument `done`. If you specified `done` in the argument list, the test case will be marked finished only when the `done` is called. This is super great when you are testing async functions.

```
jbm.runTest('TestAsync', function(done) {
  doSomeThingAsync(function() {
    done();
  });
});
```

## Reporter
Once the test case finishes, reporter will output the time usage in the following format.

```
[name] => [time used]
```

For example:

```
Test1 => 9386.461999965832
```
